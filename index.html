							<h2>Why consider a career in code?</h2>
							<p>Now is a great time to learn to code:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>There are more resources than ever for learners</li>
								<li>There’s an ever-growing community to share and exchange ideas with (on platforms like Github)</li>
								<li>Best of all, code roles pay well and there are plenty of them</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Another great reason to choose a career in code is that the roles, and the people working in them, are really diverse – there is every opportunity to specialise in an area that excites you, and along the way you’ll work alongside lots of interesting people.</p>

							<h2>What sort of person &amp; skills would it suit? </h2>

							<p>Training and working in tech is definitely not easy, so you’ll need to be resilient and committed to succeed. And technical skills, it goes without saying, are a must.</p>

							<p>That said, just knowing how to code will only get you so far – your ability to communicate and collaborate with other people across different disciplines (depending the organisation you work for, and the project you’re involved in) will help you excel.</p>

							<p>So a combination of technical competence, people skills and an ability to continuously learn could make the difference between a good career and a great one.</p>

							<p>These days, there’s not really any typical route into code. Although many of the students here at We Got Coders have some sort of IT background, we’ve also trained linguists, archaeologists, pilots, lawyers, cheese mongers, musicians, architects... you name it!</p>

							<h2>Where could a career in code take you?</h2>

							<p>Did you know how many jobs there are in tech? Thousands. If you want, being trained in code can take you miles away from the traditional roles in web and mobile app development. You could be exploring:</p>

							<ul>
								<li><b>Fintech</b>: the scope is massive, covering all kinds of technological innovation in the financial sector, from banking to bitcoin</li>
								<li><b>Health tech</b>: the playing field is wide open, from wearables and lifestyle apps to Health and remote diagnostics, to simply a better way of organising the patient roster</li>
								<li><b>Edtech</b>: this includes anything that involves using technology to deliver or enhance education, learning and development</li>
								<li><b>Startups</b>: the sky’s the limit, this could be literally anything – maybe the next Uber</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</section>

					<section  data-background-image="images/nomad3.jpg" data-background-position="center">
					  <div class="bg--ghost">
							<h2>What does it mean to be a developer?</h2>

							<p>There are three core types of development:</p>

							<ul>
								<li><b>Front-end</b> also known as client-side development is about producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or app for users to engage with</li>
								<li><b>Back-end</b> is about building and maintaining the technology and framework that powers and enables the user-facing front-end</li>
								<li><b>Full-stack</b> rolls up the full spectrum of front- and back-end</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Ultimately many developers are working towards becoming “full stack” – i.e. they can manage every layer of back-end and front-end technologies, with databases, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and everything in between.</p>

							<p>It’s important to cover all the basics of both front-end and back-end as you learn to code though. Firstly, you’ll get a better understanding of how it all works and where you want to specialize – and secondly, most companies aren’t in a rush to recruit junior front-end developers.</p>

					  	<h2>Our Approach</h2>

							<p>When it comes to learning, we don't follow the rules. Our unique
							approach combines a full-time, intensive, bootcamp-style course with mentored
							work experience placements, fast tracking you into an actual web
							developer job.</p>

							<p>We believe in learning like developers do; so we pair program,
							write tests before we code and are rigourous about best practices
							in peer-reviewed code. Get a level of support and feedback like
							you were being supported into a new web developer role, when you need it.</p>

							<p>For those who can't attend our intensive courses, we offer guided learning
							online to help you whether you are currently in-role already or
							cannot commit to a course.</p>

					  	<p>We've setup an unparalled creative space surrounded by nature,
					  	whilst staying on the outskirts of London. Our Grade II listed
					  	manor house training center doubles as a luxury guesthouse, allowing
					  	our trainees to learn round the clock and still enjoy all the home comforts.</p>

							<p>Overlooking the Lee Valley, the house has 2 classroom facilities,
							5 star accommodation, and allows us to deliver intensive courses
							and workshops simultaneously in a stress-free environment.</p>

							<p>Our resident trainees will live the dream whilst they are
							learning to code, with an on-site chef, steam room, arcade machine,
							snooker table and home cinema.</p>

				        <h4>It's residential</h4>
				        <p>
				          Escape the stress of the city and the distractions of commuting – you’ll live and breathe code with your trainers and colleagues, and we’ll take care of everything else.
			          </p>

				        <h4>It's peaceful</h4>

				        <p>
				          You’ll avoid burnout and learn more in the peace and quiet of our riverside mansion. Yet it’s still less than an hour away from London.
			          </p>

				        <h4>It's friendly</h4>

				        <p>
				          You’ll live in a creative environment with people from many different backgrounds, and you’ll get constant facetime with your trainer, meaning you can progress faster.
			          </p>

				        <h4>You’ll get paid work experience</h4>

				        <p>
				          We’ll mentor you as you gain hands-on client experience, putting your new code skills to work on live client projects. And you’ll earn at least £22,000 pro rata for it.

							<p>The teaching I received at We Got Coders was excellent. I massively endorse the way they go about it; not just teaching about how to achieve the end result, but also what's going on behind the scenes.</p>

							<p>
								For example when they taught us ActiveRecord, instead of just showing us how to use it, we first learnt about database design. Then, we learnt how to speak to it in SQL. Then, we learnt how ActiveRecord does all this for you. Only then did we learn how to use ActiveRecord, giving us a solid understanding that allowed us to master the basics.</p>


							<p>We Got Coders isn't just a course that makes you a developer, it's the first step to being a great one.</p>

							<p>This course was really fantastic.  As a female in my late 30s, I wasn't keen on a frat-house environment. And given my learning style, I respond best to small classes and personalised tuition.  I wasn't disappointed on either front.  The mansion is beautiful and quiet and our chef created delicious meals.  It meant that we were able to wholly focus on consuming the large amount of course work.  Most days I was doing 12 - 14 hours coding and loving it!</p>
	<p>The instructors clearly cared about our progress and were determined to show us how to be exceptional developers.  They made themselves available when I needed help, even if that meant evenings and weekends. </p>
	<p>For someone who was basically a beginner coder when I started, I found this a safe and positive learning environment. It's so satisfying to know that I can now confidently create well tested, well written code.</p>

							<p>When I arrived at We Got Coders I had a lot of doubts about my abilities and lack of experience. Over the next few weeks they quickly disappeared.  It’s a very intensive course, but the instructors made sure that nobody got left behind, making themselves available in the evenings and at weekends.</p>

 <p>At the end of the course students have two weeks to build an app of their own choosing from scratch, and present it for select group of industry professionals. I ended up getting hired on the spot and sent straight into a development job in London. </p>
<p>I would highly recommend this course to anyone who's serious about becoming a web developer. The accommodation is amazing, how often do you get to live in a country mansion with a professional chef cooking for you? The 3 month mentoring phase that comes after the course, is really valuable and not something that many other places offer.</p>

							<h2>Learning to code</h2>

							<p>Alright, so coding isn't always <i>that</i> easy. In fact, learning to code can be very difficult and testing, especially at the start. You'll be eager to build all of those amazing applications, games and business ideas; but you'll need to learn to walk before you can run.</p>

							<p>In many ways, learning to code will be similar to how you learned to walk and how to talk. There was a lot of trial and error; but we learned to pick ourselves up and try again. If
							you can be humble and perservering, then you'll have no problems
							learning to code in the long run.</p>

							<p>The main thing is to not berate yourself if things go wrong. That's normal! Seasoned web developers
							are used to problems with their coding and know how to deal with failure: treat it as part of the learning process. It's a process that never truly finishes; which is another reason why programming is ultimately so rewarding.</p>

							<h2>Try Coding now!</h2>

							<p>Before you dedicate time to setting up your environment, you can
							try several languages online using just your web browser. This is a
							great way to focus on learning to code rather than battling issues with

							<p>Try one of these tutorials in your coffee break. If you find them
							interesting, challenging and fun then that's a good sign that coding is indeed for you.</p>

							<h2>Getting Setup</h2>

	<p>If you're serious about learning to code, you will need to get your hands on some kit and install the following software programs. If you join one of our courses, we will make time for an installation event before it starts to assist with any problems, but as a basic minimum we would expect the following or the nearest equivalent:</p>


							<h3>Hardware</h3>

							<p>You will need to provide a laptop computer running a UNIX-based operating system, such as Mac OSX or Linux. Windows machines will not be accepted. Limited technical support is provided throughout the course, but you are expected to maintain a stable programming environment. A minimal specification for a laptop would have 2G of RAM, ideally a two-core machine at least. You will need to ensure that you have sufficient disk space.</p>

							<h3>Software</h3>

							<ul>
								<li>Web Browser: Google Chrome – lessons will be given in Chrome. Firefox is also an option and a good idea to have installed as an alternative.</li>
								<li>Text Editor: Sublime Text 2 – lessons will be given in Sublime 2. While editors are a personal preference, it helps us in class if you use Sublime 2. IDEs such as RubyMine are discouraged as they distract from learning.</li>
								<li>Terminal – iTerm for Mac, Terminator for Linux</li>
								<li>Xcode command line tools – if you're on OSX and have not 	already done so, sign-up as a developer on the apple website and install the command line tools module for your system.</li>
								<li>RVM – Details at: https://rvm.io/rvm/install. Make sure you follow the instructions and do not install as the root 	user. </li>
								<li>Homebrew (Mac OS X only) – Make sure that you are raring to brew! http://brew.sh/</li>
								<li>Heroku Toolbelt – An assortment of tools to help you deploy your apps to Heroku https://toolbelt.heroku.com/</li>
								<li>Git – Ensure that you can run the git command line tools.</li>

					    <h2>Where To Go For Help</h2>

					    <p>In practice, developers are not God-like geniuses with an
					    encyclopedic memory. They know when and where to ask for help and
					    learning how to rapidly and accurately lookup information is a very
					    important skill. Learn how to use the Internet like a textbook and
					    usually you'll find the information you need in one or two clicks.</p>

					    <p>Here are some ideas of places to get started:</p>

					    <ul>
					      <li class="slide"><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/#q=ruby+array+api&*" target="_blank">Google</a>: e.g search for "Array Ruby API" rather than "I'm stuck with arrays" </li>
					      <li class="slide"><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1538789/how-to-sum-array-of-numbers-in-ruby">Stack Overflow</a> - Good for specific questions</li>
					      <li class="slide"><a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-arrays">Quora</a> - For subjective questions</li>
					      <li class="slide"><a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/50636953258962944">Twitter</a> - For opinions and news direct from developers</li>
					      <li class="slide">Your colleagues - another reason to do the course!</li>
