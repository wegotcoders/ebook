						<p class="text">You could have a diverse and rewarding career that follows any number of different paths –it’s up to you to determine which way it goes. There are also multiple routes to get there, and how you train and gain experience is the most important decision you need to make in the short term.</p>

						<p class="text">In this ebook we’ll walk you through:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>What it means to be a developer</li>
							<li>Some of the options that could be open to you</li>
							<li>How to choose the right training for you</li>

							<h2>Are you considering a career in Web Development already?</h2>

							<p>If you're still not sure whether web development is for you, press the down arrow. If you're already convinced, spin on and press right!</p>

							<h2>Why consider a career in code?</h2>
							<p>Now is a great time to learn to code:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>There are more resources than ever for learners</li>
								<li>There’s an ever-growing community to share and exchange ideas with (on platforms like Github)</li>
								<li>Best of all, code roles pay well and there are plenty of them</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Another great reason to choose a career in code is that the roles, and the people working in them, are really diverse – there is every opportunity to specialise in area that excites you, and along the way you’ll work alongside lots of interesting people.</p>

							<h2>What sort of person &amp; skills would it suit? </h2>

							<p>Training and working in tech is definitely not easy, so you’ll need to be resilient and committed to succeed. And technical skills, it goes without saying, are a must.</p>

							<p>That said, just knowing how to code will only get you so far – your ability to communicate and collaborate with other people across different disciplines (depending the organization you work for, and the project you’re involved in) will help you excel.</p>

							<p>So a combination of technical competence, people skills and an ability to continuously learn could make the difference between a good career and a great one.</p>

							<p>These days, there’s not really any typical route into code. Although many of the students here at We Got Coders have some sort of IT background, we’ve also trained linguists, archaeologists, pilots, lawyers, cheese mongers, musicians, architects... you name it!</p>

							<h2>Where could a career in code take you?</h2>

							<p>Did you know how many jobs there are in tech? Thousands. If you want, being trained in code can take you miles away from the traditional roles in web and mobile app development. You could be exploring:</p>

							<ul>
								<li><b>Fintech</b>: the scope is massive, covering all kinds of technological innovation in the financial sector, from banking to bitcoin</li>
								<li><b>Health tech</b>: the playing field is wide open, from wearables and lifestyle apps to Health and remote diagnostics, to simply a better way of organising the patient roster</li>
								<li><b>Edtech</b>: this includes anything that involves using technology to deliver or enhance education, learning and development</li>
								<li><b>Startups</b>: the sky’s the limit, this could be literally anything – maybe the next Uber</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>What does it mean to be a developer?</h2>

							<p>There are three core types of development:</p>

							<ul>
								<li><b>Front-end</b> also known as client-side development is about producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or app for users to engage with</li>
								<li><b>Back-end</b> is about building and maintaining the technology and framework that powers and enables the user-facing front-end</li>
								<li><b>Full-stack</b> rolls up the full spectrum of front- and back-end</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Ultimately many developers are working towards becoming “full stack” – i.e. they can manage every layer of back-end and front-end technologies, with databases, PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and everything in between.</p>

							<p>It’s important to cover all the basics of both front-end and back-end as you learn to code though. Firstly, you’ll get a better understanding of how it all works and where you want to specialize – and secondly, most companies aren’t in a rush to recruit junior front-end developers.</p>
